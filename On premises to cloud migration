1. Go to VMware and export your vm as .ovf (Open Virtualization Format)
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


2. Converting OVF to OVA
You can convert your .ovf file to .ova using tools like VMware OVF Tool. Here’s how:

Download and Install VMware OVF Tool:
You can download it from VMware’s official site.

Run the Conversion Command:
Open Command Prompt and run the following command:
"C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware OVF Tool\ovftool.exe" "C:\path\to\your\Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 64-bit.ovf" "C:\path\to\your\Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 64-bit.ova"

3. Create an S3 bucket (Ex: vm-machine-bucket-tariq)
Create an S3 bucket in the region where you will create your EC2.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4. Create an IAM role named vmimport

To allow VM import/export service to perform some operation you should create a service role called ‘vmimport’.


Create a file named trust-policy.json on your computer. Add the following policy to the file:


{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": { "Service": "vmie.amazonaws.com" },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
            "StringEquals":{
               "sts:Externalid": "vmimport"
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}



$ aws iam create-role --role-name vmimport --assume-role-policy-document "file://trust-policy.json"

Create another file named role-policy.json with the following policy, Don't forget to change your bucket name with existing one !

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::vm-machine-bucket-tariq",
                "arn:aws:s3:::vm-machine-bucket-tariq/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetBucketAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::vm-machine-bucket-tariq",
                "arn:aws:s3:::vm-machine-bucket-tariq/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:ModifySnapshotAttribute",
                "ec2:CopySnapshot",
                "ec2:RegisterImage",
                "ec2:Describe*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}


$ aws iam put-role-policy --role-name vmimport --policy-name vmimport --policy-document "file://role-policy.json"
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

5. Upload that exported image to S3 Bucket

$ aws s3 mv "/home/ubuntu/Documents/centos.ova" s3://vm-machine-bucket
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

6. Import the VM image to AWS AMI Section

After you upload your VM image file to Amazon S3, you can use the AWS CLI to import the image.



Create another file named containers.json with the following policy.

Note : find S3 key name like: under your bucket


[
  {
    "Description": "My Server OVA",
    "Format": "ova",
    "UserBucket": {
        "S3Bucket": "vm-machine-bucket-tariq",
        "S3Key": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 64-bit.ova"
    }
  }
]




$ aws ec2 import-image --description "My On-Premise Centos VM" --disk-containers "file://containers.json"

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

7. Monitor an import image task

Note: Replace "import-ami-1234567890abcdef0" from above output ImportTaskId

$ aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks --import-task-ids import-ami-1234567890abc7f744


Status values include the following:
active — The import task is in progress.
deleting — The import task is being canceled.
deleted — The import task is canceled.
updating — Import status is updating.
validating — The imported image is being validated.
validated — The imported image was validated.
converting — The imported image is being converted into an AMI.
completed — The import task is completed and the AMI is ready to use

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
8. After Completed import image task, Let's check AMI section

  Finally ! Launch EC2 Instance through that AMI
